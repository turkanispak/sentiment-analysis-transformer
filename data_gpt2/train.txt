Agent: Thank you for calling BrownBox customer support. My name is Rachel. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Rachel, I have a question about my recent order. I received an email asking me to ship the item for an Induction Cooktop. Can you explain why I'm being asked to ship it?

Agent: Sure, I can help you with that. May I have your order number, please?

Customer: Yes, it's BB789012.

Agent: Thank you, let me check that for you. It looks like the Induction Cooktop you ordered is a large item that requires special handling during shipping. Due to the size and weight, it's difficult for our delivery partners to carry it up to your apartment or home without causing damage to the item or your property. Therefore, we are asking you to ship the item to your address using our partnered shipping service. 

Customer: Oh, I see. That makes sense. How do I go about shipping it?

Agent: It's quite simple. We will send you an email with the shipping label and instructions on how to prepare the item for shipping.
